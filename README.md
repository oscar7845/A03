Task – Add and commit file(s)

Task – Push the repository to GitHub


**Branch** :
A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary 
or main branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version.

**Clone** :
A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of
making that copy.

**Commit** :
A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). When you make a commit to save your work,
GIT creates a unique ID that allows you to keep record of that specific changes committed along with who made them and
when.

**Fetch** :
When you use git fetch, you're adding changes from the remote repository to your local working branch without committing
them.

**GIT** :
Git is an extremely popular version control system that is at the heart of a wide variety of high-profile projects.
Git is installed and maintained on your local system nd gives you a self-contained record of your ongoing programming 
versions.

**GitHub** :
GitHub is designed as a Git repository hosting service.
A Git repository hosting service is an online database that allows you to keep track of and share your Git version 
control projects outside your local computer/server.

**Merge** :
Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another.
This often happens as a "pull request" (which can be thought of as a request to merge), or via the command line.
A merge can be done through a pull request via the GitHub.com web interface if there are no conflicting changes, or can 
always be done via the command line.

**Merge Conflict** :
A difference that occurs between merged branches. Merge conflicts happen when people make different changes to the same
line of the same file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file. The merge conflict must
be resolved before you can merge the branches.

**Push** :
To push means to send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com. For instance, if you change something
locally, you can push those changes so that others may access them.

**Pull** :
Pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them. For instance, if someone has edited the remote file
you're both working on, you'll want to pull in those changes to your local copy so that it's up to date. See also fetch.

**Remote** :
This is the version of a repository or branch that is hosted on a server, most likely GitHub.com. Remote versions can be
connected to local clones so that changes can be synced.

**Repository** :
A directory or storage space where your projects can live. Sometimes GitHub users shorten this to “repo.” It can be 
local to a folder on your computer, or it can be a storage space on GitHub or another online host.
